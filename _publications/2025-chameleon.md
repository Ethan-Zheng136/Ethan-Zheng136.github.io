## Abstract
We developed a neuro-symbolic algorithm combining symbolic reasoning over detected instances with Chain-of-Thought-based visual language models (VLMs) to handle corner cases in lane topology extraction, achieving consistent improvements on OpenLane-V2 dataset while reducing inference time from >200s to 0.1-8s per frame.

## Key Contributions
- **Program Synthesis Framework**: Generated executable Python code based on few-shot visual/text prompts, expert rules, and API descriptions to reason over spatial relationships
- **Dense Visual Prompting VQA Benchmark**: Designed benchmark tasks (lane adjacency, direction matching, intersection inclusion) and evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-4-vision, LLaVA, and ResNet18-based MLP for understanding complex 3D driving scenes
- **Performance Improvements**: Achieved consistent improvements on **OpenLane-V2** dataset in 3-shot settings, matching or outperforming fully supervised baselines without additional finetuning
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced inference time from **>200s to 0.1-8s per frame**, with ablation studies showing **5% accuracy improvement** through expert rules and few-shot examples
- **Real-world Impact**: Delivered cost-efficient and scalable solution for real-time deployment in mapless autonomous driving, significantly lowering computational cost and carbon footprint
